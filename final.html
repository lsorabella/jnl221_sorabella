			<h3>Summary of the Dataset</h3>

			<p id="with-element" style= "font-family: Roboto"> This dataset looks at how women around the world have proven themselves as global competitors with stamina and determination, and how the number of women participants and events have increased over the last century in the Games of the Olympiad, looking specifically at the data from the Winter Games. </p>
			<p style= "font-family:Roboto"> My findings and dataset are newsworthy because of Gender Equality in sports and specifically the Olympic Games which are supposed to display men and women who excel in their respective sports. It’s important to analyze gaps or stagnant statistics in the data, and analyze where we are now to improve gender equality even more into the next century. While the 2022 statistics have certainly shown progression since 1924, women are still less than 50% of the Winter Olympic population. </p>

			<h3>Findings</h3>
			<p style= "font-family:Roboto"> My first visual is a chart of all my data sections to see the difference in women-only events, mixed events between men and women, total events in the Olympics that year, how many women participated, and how many people total participated each year. From these statistics, I found that the number of women who competed in the games right after World War II in 1948 had a 3.75% decrease of women competitors compared to the pre-war 1936 games. This was a big setback for women in sports especially considering the 1936 games were when women’s presence in the Games was first starting to increase. </p>
			<p style= "font-family: Roboto"> Another finding I discovered was from the most current Olympics. I found that it was 3.84 times more likely to have a Women’s Only event in the 2022 games than a Mixed Event between men and women. I found this surprising because in the present day we have proven to be just as capable as men in most sports.</p>
			<p style= "font-family: Roboto"> Lydia Nsekera, the Chair for the Women in Sports Commission for the International Olympic Committee said something similar in her speech to the International Olympic Committee in 2015. “It once was assumed that football — and rugby or cricket —was for men; that women were supposed to do dance or ballet, which men could not do. It was assumed that in sports women could not perform as well as men. But now we understand that men can do the ballet that the women were supposed to be doing, and women can do the sports that the men do. This only happens if we are able to make these opportunities accessible to boys and girls of all walks of life and all classes. It was once argued that women would remain at home and that women could not cope with being out on the field. In having the courage to contest and disprove such gender stereotypes, women and girl athletes make an unquestioned contribution to gender equality.” (UN Women) </p>

			<h3>Important Women in the Olympics</h3>
			<p style= "font-family: Roboto">I had the opportunity to talk to Erin Nelson-Meek, the director of Guest Experience at the United States Olympic and Paralympic Museum, on the different exhibits the museum has to highlight women’s accomplishments throughout Olympic history. She said, “At the USOPM, we do our best to highlight both the Olympics and the Paralympics equally and the successes of both male and female athletes equally. We have an exhibit with Vonetta Flowers's (the first Black athlete to win a gold medal at the Winter Games in 2002) bobsled on display. We also have a mono-ski from Sarah Will, the most decorated athlete in the U.S. Paralympic Alpine Skiing Team history, winning a total of 13 medals, 12 gold and 1 silver.” </p>
			<div id="list">
				<h4>Top Winter Olympic Women Athletes</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Marit Bjorden, Norway, Cross-Country, 15 Medals</li>
					<li>Ole Einar Bjorndalen, Norway, Biathlon, 13 Medals</li>
					<li>Ireen Wust, Netherlands, Speed Skating, 13 Medals</li>
					<li>Bjorn Daehlie, Norway, Cross-Country, 12 Medals</li>
					<li>Arianna Fontana, Italy, Short track, 11 Medals</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<p style= "font-family: Roboto">Other exhibits include notable parts of Women in Sport history, such as Title IX, the civil rights law in the United States that was enacted in 1972 which prohibits sex-based discrimination. The amount of Women Events in the Winter Olympics doubled from 1972 to 1992 from 12 to 23 as we saw the law be implemented more and more into the world of sports. “The introduction of Title IX was so crucial to women in the sports realm, that we felt it was important to highlight that in our museum,” says Nelson-Meek. </p>
      <p style= "font-family: Roboto">The movement of USA’s Women’s Gymnastics and Safesport Initiative, the protection of athletes, especially women, preventing emotional, physical, and sexual misconduct and abuse in the U.S. The Olympic and Paralympic Movement is also an exhibit in the museum, in regard to how female athletes are going to be protected in the future. </p>

			<h3>Limitations</h3>
			<p style= "font-family: Roboto">Some limitations I ran into creating this dataset was not having the same statistics for the Summer Olympics. I think comparing these same statistics between Summer and Winter Games would have been an interesting data finding, but I unfortunately couldn’t find a data table that had the same groupings for Summer Olympics. </p>
			<p style= "font-family: Roboto">This dataset was published in December of 2021, so the 2022 numbers were partially projections although at that point it was reported who would be competing so the data is still pretty accurate. I would have liked to explore Paralympic statistics more because disabled women, and people for that matter, have even more of a stigma against them when it comes to being a competitor. </p>
